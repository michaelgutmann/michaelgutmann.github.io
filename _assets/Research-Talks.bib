  month     = {May},
  abstract  = {Statistical models may be specified in terms of stochastic computer program - a simulator - which can generate samples from the model for any configuration of the parameters. While such models support complex data generating mechanisms, the likelihood function is generally incomputable which renders statistical inference difficult. Several likelihoodfree inference methods have been proposed which share the basic idea of identifying the model parameters by finding values for which the discrepancy between simulated and observed data is small. Examples are indirect inference and approximate Bayesian computation. A major obstacle to using these methods is their computational cost. The cost is largely due to the need to repeatedly simulate data sets and the lack of knowledge about how the parameters affect the discrepancy. We propose a strategy which combines probabilistic modeling of the discrepancy with optimization to facilitate likelihood-free inference. The strategy is implemented using Bayesian optimization and is shown to accelerate the inference through a reduction in the number of required simulations by several orders of magnitude.},
